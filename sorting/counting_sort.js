* If we somehow know the maximum value,
* we can use this algorithm to sort a collection in linear time and space! 
* The maximum value lets us create an array of that size to count the occurrence of each index value.
* Then, itâ€™s just a matter of extracting all the indexes that have non-zero counts into our result array. 
* By exploiting the constant-time lookup of arrays, this hash-like algorithm is the most performant possible.
